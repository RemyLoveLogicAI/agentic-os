> A voice-native operating system for the Agentic Web.

**One loop**: speak → route → approve → act → verify → remember.

## What It Is

Agentic OS is a layered control system that turns spoken intent into verified action.

It combines:
- **Spokenly** — voice clarification and MCP-driven question capture
- **Voice Orion** — deterministic command parsing and approval gates
- **Command Palette** — fast command discovery and selection
- **DLAM / R1** — desktop and machine control
- **OpenClaw** — orchestration and multi-agent coordination
- **R.I.P.** — canonical memory and identity
- **Knowledge Graph** — operational context
- **Aegis / Violet Covenant** — governance and trust policy
- **zopack** — portable bundles
- **glyphy pets / CYOA** — ambient state and narrative UX

---

## Why It Exists

Most agent stacks fail in three places:

1. They cannot ask clarifying questions reliably.
2. They cannot execute safely across desktop and API surfaces.
3. They cannot remember what happened in a canonical, auditable way.

Agentic OS closes all three gaps.

## Quickstart

### Read the Spec

```bash
# Clone or download
open spec-pack/README.md
```

### Understand the Loop

1. Human speaks or types a request.
2. Command edge classifies intent.
3. Governance decides if the action is safe.
4. Execution plane performs the action.
5. Evidence is captured.
6. Memory is updated.
7. System learns for the next round.

### Build Phase-0

See `spec-pack/phase-0-build-plan.md` for the first shippable slice.

## Status

This repo is the **spec and operating narrative**.

Implementation follows a phase-0 slice:

- [ ] Voice clarification loop
- [ ] Deterministic router
- [ ] Approval gate
- [ ] One safe desktop action
- [ ] One safe API action
- [ ] Evidence logging

## Deliverables

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | This document |
| `spec-pack/README.md` | Pack overview |
| `spec-pack/master-spec.md` | Canonical system contract |
| `spec-pack/deployment-blueprint.md` | Deployment stages |
| `spec-pack/phase-0-build-plan.md` | First slice |
| `spec-pack/repo-layout.md` | Folder structure |
| `spec-pack/assets/*.png` | Architecture diagrams |

---

## Philosophy

- **No proof, no claim.** Evidence required.
- **Prefer reversible decisions.** Keep options open.
- **Keep the first slice thin and real.** Ship, then iterate.
- **Treat memory as a product surface.** It matters.
- **Treat governance as a feature.** Not an afterthought.
